XML/Generator/RSS10/egms version 0.02
=====================================

This module extends Dave Rolsky's XML::Generator::RSS10 to
provide support for the UK e-Government Metadata Standard (egms)
RSS 1.0 specfication.

For UK government RSS feeds, much of the mandatory eGMS
metadata is provided through the standard Dublin Core
module. However, the subject category metadata is mandatory,
and uses rather more complicated RDF XML notation than
regular Dublin Core, principally because you're encouraged
to pass more than one category for each item.

I've taken the specification for using eGMS metadata in RSS
feeds from the LAWS Syndication Guidelines, at:
